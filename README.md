# Reinforcement_Traffic_Project

This is our graduation project 
"Training Reinforcement Learning Agent for traffic Signal Control"

So we use Reinforcement learning for control traffic signal and simulation of urban mobility(SUMO)
for simulate traffic network , we use Traci[python script] for communication between Reinforcement learning and SUMO

Thank you;
